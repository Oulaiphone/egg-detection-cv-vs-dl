# 🥚 Egg Detection: Traditional Computer Vision vs Deep Learning

Final research project comparing traditional computer vision and deep learning (Faster R-CNN) for cage-free floor egg detection.

> **📝 Note:** This project was developed in 2020 as part of the STEP Program at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. The code may not run on modern systems due to outdated dependencies, but is preserved here to showcase the methodology and findings.

## Overview

Object detection is an essential computer vision technique that enables classification and localization of objects in images. This pilot study implements and compares two approaches for egg detection:

1. **Traditional Computer Vision** - Using handcrafted features with OpenCV
2. **Deep Learning** - Using Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network)

The goal was to understand the strengths and limitations of each approach for potential applications in automated egg collection systems in the egg industry.

## Key Findings

| Metric | Traditional CV | Faster R-CNN |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Precision** | 99% | 99% |
| **Data Required** | Minimal | Large (1,066 images) |
| **Training Time** | None | ~200,000 iterations |
| **Feature Learning** | Manual/Handcrafted | Automatic/Semantic |

### Summary

- Both methods achieved **99% precision** in egg detection
- Traditional CV works well for simplified, controlled environments with minimal data
- Faster R-CNN can learn deeper, semantic features and adapt to various settings and environments
- Deep learning requires significantly more data and computational resources

## Methods

### Traditional Computer Vision Approach

The traditional pipeline uses handcrafted feature extraction:

```
Input Image → BGR-HSV Conversion → Channel Split → Morphological Closing 
→ Distance Transform → Template Creation → Template Matching 
→ Local Maxima Detection → Contour Finding → Output
```

### Deep Learning Approach (Faster R-CNN)

The Faster R-CNN architecture consists of:

- **Region Proposal Network (RPN)** - Generates candidate object regions
- **RoI Pooling** - Extracts fixed-size features from proposals  
- **Classifier** - Predicts object class and refines bounding boxes

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Dataset preparation (191 images → 1,066 via data augmentation)
2. Image labeling using LabelImg (Pascal VOC format)
3. TFRecord generation for TensorFlow
4. Transfer learning from `faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28`
5. Training for 200,000 iterations
6. Model export as inference graph (.pb files)

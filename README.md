# Traditional Computer Vision vs. Deep Learning for Cage-Free Floor Egg Detection

This repository contains the final report for a supervised research project conducted at
Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (2019–2020).

## Overview
The project compares traditional computer vision techniques with a Faster R-CNN deep learning
approach for cage-free floor egg detection in agricultural environments.

## Methods
- Traditional computer vision pipeline using handcrafted features
- Deep learning–based object detection using Faster R-CNN
- Dataset preparation, augmentation, model training, and evaluation

## Results
- Achieved 99% detection precision
- Deep learning demonstrated improved robustness and generalization in complex, cage-free environments

## Supervision
Supervisor: Seiji Hotta, Associate Professor  
Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology
